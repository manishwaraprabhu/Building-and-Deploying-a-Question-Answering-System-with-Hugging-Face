**Project Overview**
This project implements a Question Answering (QA) System using Hugging Face's Transformers and Streamlit. We fine-tuned a DistilBERT model for extractive question answering using the SQuAD dataset and deployed it as an interactive Streamlit web application.

**Project Workflow**
âœ… Step 1: Dataset Preparation
ðŸ”¹ Loaded and preprocessed the SQuAD dataset for fine-tuning.
ðŸ”¹ Extracted context, questions, and answers, ensuring correct start-end token mappings.
ðŸ”¹ Converted the dataset into the Hugging Face dataset format for training.
ðŸ”¹ Saved the processed dataset as train_data.csv and validation_data.csv for further use.

âœ… Step 2: Baseline Model (Pretrained DistilBERT Evaluation)
ðŸ”¹ Loaded train_data.csv and validation_data.csv for model evaluation.
ðŸ”¹ Loaded pretrained DistilBERT (distilbert-base-cased) for zero-shot question answering.
ðŸ”¹ Evaluated the model on the validation dataset before fine-tuning.
ðŸ”¹ Measured initial Exact Match (EM) and F1 scores as benchmarks.
ðŸ”¹ Observed that the pretrained model struggled with domain-specific questions.
ðŸ”¹ Saved the baseline model as baseline_model for further fine-tuning.

âœ… Step 3: Fine-Tuning the DistilBERT Model
ðŸ”¹ Loaded the previously saved baseline_model for fine-tuning.
ðŸ”¹ Fine-tuned DistilBERT on the SQuAD dataset using the Hugging Face Trainer API.
ðŸ”¹ Used AdamW optimizer and learning rate scheduling for optimal training.
ðŸ”¹ Set batch size, epochs, and gradient accumulation to balance performance.
ðŸ”¹ Saved the best fine-tuned model as best_fine_tuned_model after training.

âœ… Step 4: Model Evaluation
ðŸ”¹ Compared the baseline vs fine-tuned model performance.
ðŸ”¹ Evaluated both models using SQuAD metrics (EM & F1 score).
ðŸ”¹ Achieved improved EM: 74.50% and F1: 83.07% after fine-tuning.
ðŸ”¹ Saved incorrect predictions for further error analysis & improvements.
ðŸ”¹ Visualized performance gains using matplotlib bar charts.
ðŸ”¹ Generated an evaluation report (evaluation_report.json) with key metrics.

âœ… Step 5: Deployment via Streamlit
ðŸ”¹ Built a Streamlit web application for real-time question answering.
ðŸ”¹ Loaded the fine-tuned model (best_fine_tuned_model) for inference.
ðŸ”¹ Implemented context input, question input, and answer retrieval.
ðŸ”¹ Handled edge cases (invalid inputs, model errors, and incorrect answers).
ðŸ”¹ Tested the app with real-world queries, ensuring usability & performance.

**Final Results: Performance Comparison**   	
Baseline Model	 -   Exact Match (EM): 71.75%,	   F1 Score: 80.65%
Fine-Tuned Model -   Exact Match (EM): 74.50%,	   F1 Score: 83.07%
ðŸ”¹ Fine-tuning improved model accuracy by ~3% (EM) and ~2.5% (F1 Score).
ðŸ”¹ Deployment successfully enables real-time QA interaction via a web UI.

**Conclusion**
This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of training, fine-tuning, evaluating, and deploying a Question Answering model using Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch, and Streamlit. By fine-tuning DistilBERT on SQuAD, we successfully improved its performance and built an interactive QA system for real-time inference.
